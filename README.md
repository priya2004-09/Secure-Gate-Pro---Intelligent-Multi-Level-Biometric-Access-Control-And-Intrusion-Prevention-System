# Secure-Gate-Pro---Intelligent-Multi-Level-Biometric-Access-Control-And-Intrusion-Prevention-System
SecureGate Pro is an LPC2148-based biometric security system that provides multi-level authentication using User ID, password, and fingerprint verification. It supports fingerprint enrollment, deletion, password management, EEPROM-based user storage, and motor-controlled door access with UART-based security logging to prevent unauthorized entry.

# 1. Overview

SecureGate Pro is an embedded biometric security system developed using an ARM7 LPC21xx microcontroller. It provides multi-level authentication by combining user ID verification, password authentication, and fingerprint recognition before granting access to a secured area.

The system uses an R305 fingerprint sensor for biometric identification, a 4×4 matrix keypad for user input, and an LCD for displaying system messages. User information and password data are stored in an external I2C EEPROM. After successful authentication, a motor-driven mechanism opens the door. The system also maintains UART-based access logs to record authentication events, access permissions, and door operations.

An administrator can access a dedicated menu to manage passwords and fingerprint records.

# 2. Objectives

- Develop a secure embedded access control system using an ARM7 microcontroller.
- Implement multi-level authentication using user ID, password, and fingerprint verification.
- Store user information and password data in external EEPROM.
- Provide fingerprint enrollment, identification, and deletion facilities.
- Control door opening and closing through a motor interface.
- Display authentication status and system messages using an LCD.
- Maintain serial logs of successful and unsuccessful access attempts.
- Provide administrator functionality for password and fingerprint management.

- Fingerprint enrollment and identification commands.
- Password comparison and user record management.
- Motor control and event handling.

### 6.3 Storage Layer

- UART0 sends access and system event logs to a serial terminal.

## 7. System Working

1. **System Initialization:** The LPC21xx controller initializes UART0, UART1, I2C, LCD, keypad, and external interrupt peripherals.

2. **User ID Verification:** The user enters a four-digit ID using the keypad. The controller checks the entered ID against the registered user information stored in EEPROM.

3. **Password Authentication:** If the user ID is valid, the system requests a four-digit password and compares it with the stored password.

4. **Fingerprint Verification:** After successful password verification, the system asks the user to place their finger on the R305 fingerprint sensor.

5. **Access Decision:** The fingerprint sensor captures the fingerprint and searches its stored templates. If a match is found, the system grants access.

6. **Door Operation:** The controller activates the motor driver to open the door. The LCD displays the door status.

7. **Door Closing:** The user operates the external switch to initiate the door-closing operation. The controller activates the motor in the reverse direction.

8. **Event Logging:** UART0 records user authentication, access granted or denied, fingerprint status, and door operation events.

9. **Administrator Mode:** An external interrupt activates the administrator menu, allowing password updates and fingerprint enrollment, searching, and deletion.
